The use of such loops will immediately mark your solution as \"Not Yet\" because one large purpose of this exam is to assess your skills at taking advantage of the data science libraries.\n",

    "I first filtered by those with a high chance of a heart attack. 43.6% of the filtered data are women. I define the true mean as 50% because in broad generalities half of the world's population is men and the other half women and there are only two genders in this data set. Assuming that n is large enough that the central limit theorem holds,  we would need 247 observations to conclude that the probability of observing 43.6% is at most 5%. However, we only have 165 samples, so we do not have enough.\n",

    "I filtered the data by whether they had an exercise induced angina and then looked at the proportion of women vs men. I defined the true proportion as 50% since the data set is using a binary gender. I calculated that we would need 13 samples to have enough observations to conclude that the probability of observing the empirical proportion is at most 5%. Since the data I filtered for has 99 samples we do have enough observations. (**Code part assigns `n_filtered` to a DataFrame**)\n",

    "From the given data, we observe that 22.22% of those who get angina when they exercise are women. If we are assuming that n is large enough that the central limit theorem holds and the true proportion is 50%, we would need 10 observations to conclude that the P(of observing 22.22%) <= 5%. The current example we have does have enough samples as there are 99 samples and we only need 10. Looking at the data this makes sense to me because the delta is large indicating that the value of n itself will be smaller.
