    "1. A website is trying to increase registration for first-time visitors, exposing a random subset of these visitors to a new site design. Of $752$ randomly sampled visitors over a month who saw the new design, $64$ registered. Construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the percentage of visitors who would register for the website under the new design using the normal distribution. Save your answer in a tuple `q1_1` with two `numpy.float64` items that `q1_1[0]` is the left bound and `q1_1[1]` is the right bound. Use percentages for both bounds, for example, save $50.0$ in your answer for $50\\%$ of visitors.\n",
    "2. A study examined the average pay for a random sample of men and women entering the workforce as doctors for $21$ different positions. If each gender was equally paid, then we would expect about half of those positions to have men paid more than women and women would be paid more than men in the other half of positions. In the study, men were, on average, paid more in $17$ of the $21$ positions. Complete a hypothesis test using the normal distribution (two-sided or one-sided, just be clear which you are reporting) to examine whether there is significant evidence (at the $0.05$ level) of gender discrimination in pay in these positions. Report your p-value and interpret the result. Save your p-value in `q1_2` as a `numpy.float64` and interpret it in the **Answer 1.2** cell."
