    "In this exercise, you will demonstrate your learning by solving probability problems. Many of these will be math problems. You can nicely format your answers in Markdown cells using LaTeX-like commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some particular LaTeX commands you might find useful include:\n",
    "- To display an inline math expression, enclose the content in single dollar signs (e.g., $x^2+4=8$).\n",
    "- To display a single-line centered math expression, enclose the content in double dollar signs like $$P(X > 5) = \\frac{1}{6}.$$\n",
    "- To display a multi-line math expression, use `\\begin{equation}` and `\\end{equation}`, and use `\\\\` to change lines. See the example below.\n",
    "- (Advanced) To align lines nicely, use `\\begin{align}` and `\\end{align}`, and put `&` wherever you want the lines to align.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To write a fraction, use `\\frac{numerator}{denominator}` like $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n",
    "- To write set intersection and union, use `\\cap` and `\\cup` respectively, like $A \\cap B$ and $A \\cup B$.\n",
    "- To write a bar over something (like a set complement), use `\\overline{}` like in $\\overline{E}$.\n",
    "- To write a subscript or superscript, use `_{}` or `^{}` as in $X_{n}$ or $X^{2}$.\n",
    "- To write a sum or product, use `\\sum` or `\\prod` as in $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$ or $\\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i$.\n",
    "- To write text inside math expressions, use `\\text{}` as in $P(D \\text{ is even})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to LaTeX, see the [overleaf documentation for mathematical expressions](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/mathematical_expressions). Note that not all LaTeX commands work in Markdown cells, as they are technically not actual LaTeX environments. \n",

    "For example, question 1.4 in the worked examples has you calculate the probability of \"A die roll greater than or equal to 3 or a coin toss of tails (possibly both).\" A full credit answer to this would be:\n",

    "## Question 5 (2 points auto-graded, 3 points manually graded)\n",
    "In the US presidential election, there are typically two candidates: a Democratic candidate and a Republican candidate. Each state has a number of electoral college votes. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state receives all of the electoral college votes for that particular state (there are a couple of exceptions, but to keep things simple we will assume this is how it works for all states). A candidate who wins at least 270 electoral college votes wins the national election. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "Below we import the `polls.csv` dataset describing the 2020 US presidential election and preview the first few rows. For each of the 50 states in the USA plus Washington D.C. (which has electoral college votes like a state), the dataset records:\n",
    "- `d_percent`: The percent of polled voters indicating they will vote for the Democratic candidate in the 2020 presidential election.\n",
    "- `r_percent`: The percent of polled voters indicating they will vote for the Republican candidate in the 2020 presidential election.\n",
    "- `ec_weight`: The number of electoral college votes controlled by the particular state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will do\n",
    "**In this question, you will write a Monte Carlo simulation to understand the probabilities of the following three events.** This is based roughly on the idea of computational models for predicting election outcomes such as those you may have seen recently in the news. \n",
    "- $D$: the Democratic candidate wins at least 270 electoral college votes (and thus the presidential election);\n",
    "- $R$: the Republican candidate wins at least 270 electoral college votes (and thus the presidential election); \n",
    "- $U$: neither candidate gets 270 electoral college votes and the election is undecided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How you will do it\n",
    "To do so, model the uncertainty in the poll numbers as follows. For each simulation:\n",
    "1. For each state independently draw 0-mean normally distributed random `noise` for a given standard deviation estimate $\\sigma$. You can do so, for example, using [numpy.random.normal](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html). This reflects the assumption that the poll numbers are not certain and could vary in either direction by one or two standard deviations.\n",
    "2. Add `noise` (independently for each state) to `d_percent` and subtract `noise` from `r_percent`. So if you get `noise = 1.5`, `d_percent = 42`, and `r_percent = 57` you would get `43.5` for the new `d_percent` and `55.5` for the new `r_percent`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then for a given simulation you can check which of $D$, $R$, or $U$ occur by checking, for each state, which candidate gets a larger share of the vote, and adding up their electoral votes accross all of the states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that **each simulation starts with the original values** from the `polls` dataset, not the results from the previous simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code the simulation and then **run 10,000 simulations for each of the following values of $\\sigma$: 1, 5, and 10. For each, report the empirical probability of the events $D$, $R$, and $U$.** You should therefore have a total of 9 values. Report your values by creating three lists `q5_1`, `q5_5`, and `q5_10`, one for each $\\sigma$. The first value of each list is the number of simulations the Democrats won, the second value is the number the Republicans won, and the final value is for Undecided.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may take a few seconds for your simulations to run, but if they are running for minutes, you are likely writing inefficient loops instead of taking advantage of efficient Pandas and Numpy operations. You will need one loop over the 10,000 simulations but should not need any others.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: We recommend that you write the following functions:*\n",
    "1. *A function that takes a `DataFrame` of votes where the noise has already been added and returns who has won based on the electoral college votes per state.*\n",
    "1. *A function that simulates an election by taking a `DataFrame` of vote/poll data and a standard deviation and adds noise.*\n",
    "1. *A function that runs all the simulations for a specific standard deviation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*It'll make your code easier to write and understand.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "For the sake of consistency and easy debugging, we recommend that you do the following when you are ready to submit:\n",
    "1. Surround your code with triple quotes (e.g. `''' <code here in many lines> '''`, see example below).\n",
    "1. Outside the triple quotes, manually assign the values of `q5_1`, `q5_5`, and `q5_10` with the values of the last time you ran your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep your code in your notebook so that it can be manually graded. But we do not want the autograder to timeout and therefore give you a 0."
